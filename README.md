## Summary

### Problem
- **Small-business owners** and **service providers** that are struggling financially need to be **prioritized** and given more **visibility** in online spaces.
- **Potential customers** are interested in supporting and buying from struggling local small service businesses.

### Solution
Create a website that allows users to search and browse local service providers, prioritizing businesses based on each company's critical **need**, rather than rating or popularity.

## Background and Context
With **small service businesses** shuttering around the country, Villagr has identified a way to help **uplift and positively impact small businesses** and help them reach new customers and stay connected to the community. What happens when no one is out in the world, looking for places to try? With our mission to help small businesses stay relevant in a virtual society, we pivoted to making sure customers can share and book businesses that most urgently need local rallying support to survive. Villagr is built to help small businesses gain the visibility to reach new audiences, and to inspire folks to support local entrepreneurship.

The Villagr team is a group of innovators and changemakers dedicated to business transformation.

As Grace Hopper, inventor of the **common business** -oriented language (COBOL), once said:
```
Humans are allergic to change. 
They love to say, 'We've always done it this way.' I try to fight that. 
```

## Data Insights

**Discoveries & Features**     |  **Explanation**

Source | Our Data comes from the SBA’s Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program.
Relevance | With data current as of December 2020, this program offered an emergency provision of working capital to small businesses impacted by the pandemic.
Defining Need | The size of the loan amount is a useful proxy for “how much injury” was sustained.
Feature Engineering | Quartile ranks were calculated based on loan size.
User Opportunity | The user gains visibility into the scale of their financial impact on a recovering business in their city or state.

## React
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
